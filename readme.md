# Digital Storage and Computing in the Medical Industry

For my internship with [Aurion](https://aurion.com/) during October 2021, one of the activities was a group project to conduct research and host a presentation on a given topic. As for the group I was in, we chose to research cloud computing solutions in the health sector during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This repository contains markdown conversions of the presentation slides that I was responsible for. As a group, we agreed that we would all research a particular aspect of the overall topic. We then compiled our research notes together into what became the final presentation. When we performed it live, we each spoke on the slides corresponding to our individual research.

The group project was conducted across 18-22 October 2021. I converted my slides to markdown and shared them publicly on 19 January 2022.
